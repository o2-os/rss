    <p>yea so, I'm working on this site. I thought it would be fun. I'm basically planning to replace all of my social media with it. I think a lot of fun ideas will sprout out of it. I wanted to first use this as an opportunity to document my output for my radio show, and any other related music updates. I've been talking with other friends and finding that they are interested in that too. For a while, I've had thoughts about having a slower, more intentional, more patient relationship to technology. It's a sad thing that so many artists feel that they 'need' to opt into big tech plaforms just to 'be in the game.' I reject that idea, and think that having a handmade diy web cultivates more exploratory and meaningful interactions that are less socially engineered to make us consume and buy things.</s></p>
