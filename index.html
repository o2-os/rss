            <h1>Beginner's Mind</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Hello. Beginner's Mind is a mindset that aims to treat all things
                like you are new to them; like a beginner. It is said that by doing this, one approaches
                things like a child; pure, innocent, playfully, curiously.

                By approaching life in this way, one lets go of the need to conquer everything. Instead of treating
                everything does as something to be achieved, a skill to be mastered, or even something to base one's worth
                from, we can see things from a fresh lens. It is often said that the more learn, the less we know.
